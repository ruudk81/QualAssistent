# Topic 4: Concept/Product Idea Evaluation (3 Concepts)
**Group:** Finland Group 1
**Transcript:** transcript_groep1_FI.txt
**Lines:** 319-489

## Overview
Participants evaluated three product concepts presented as work-in-progress ideas. Moderator emphasized focus on the idea itself, not the specific wording or text polish (lines 320-325). Three concepts tested: Quick Mint, Clean Feel, and Long Extreme Fresh.

## CONCEPT 1: Quick Mint (lines 328-379)

**Concept Description** (lines 330-334)
- "The fastest and easiest solution for freshening your breath when you're on the go"
- Small size, quick effect
- For situations requiring fast breath freshening

### Reactions to Product Size

**Positive on Convenience** (line 338)
- "I think that kind of size is pretty convenient"

**Not Suitable for Some** (lines 339-341)
- "I usually know how to plan in advance, so I don't really have a situation where I need to very quickly, immediately get a fresher breath"
- "I also like to enjoy sucking on the pastille for a little bit, so I wouldn't buy this"

**Good for Specific Situations** (lines 343-345)
- "When I want to have something quick and discreet that dissolves quickly, that's very helpful"
- "And then if it actually covers up the smoking smell and it also keeps me fresh, then that's great"

### Major Barrier: Overconsumption Concern (lines 346-351)

**Can't Stop at One** (line 346-350)
- "I have the personal issue with pastilles that taste good and usually I can't just have one of them. Then I tend to have a couple of them and then very quickly I tend to have the whole box"
- Concept seems designed for one per day: "this is probably meant to be for situations where I face a situation where I would like to have a pastille... then the next one I would have on the next day" (lines 348-349)
- "For me that would not happen" (line 349)
- Reason: "because I prefer buying pastilles that taste good" (line 350)

### Size Concerns (lines 352-355)

**Too Small?** (lines 352-354)
- "I don't feel the need to have it small and I don't feel the need to have my eating of pastilles discreet, so I'm a little bit critical about the size"
- "I think it's also a little bit too small, would be my concern"

**Solution: Eat More** (line 354-355)
- "But maybe I can just eat more of them if I have to, like a whole handful"

### Credibility Issues (lines 356-366)

**Skeptical About Claims** (lines 357-359)
- "I'm a little bit skeptical, that it doesn't sound too credible"
- "It doesn't sound too credible"

**Core Contradiction: Quick + Long-lasting** (lines 360-364)
- "If it dissolves quickly, then I feel that if it lasts longer, it has more effect. Then I get from this more the feeling that it comes quickly and it goes quickly" (lines 360-361)
- "The credibility here is being questioned. If it dissolves quickly and it's very small and it has to also last long, how can such a small pastille last long if it dissolves quickly?" (lines 362-363)
- "I'm a little bit suspicious of it" (line 365)

**Suggested Fix** (lines 366-370)
- "It should somehow emphasize that it's so dense, it's so condensed that you can chew it and it will still last a long time. It's so well packed in the pastille"
- But skepticism remains: "Of course it's thin and small that it dissolves quickly" (line 370)

### Positive Reaction: Quick Freshness (lines 372-379)

**Appeal of Speed** (lines 372-376)
- "I was very... very quick fresher feeling in my mouth. That's where the quick dissolving is good if it actually works and works as it says"
- "That would be just a quick fix before I start something so you're not having a big blue pastille in your mouth when you're meeting someone"

**Unplanned Situations** (lines 376-379)
- "If I plan ahead, then I can take my time chewing on a longer pastille... but if I'm just showing up, then I would like to have this"
- Eliminates gum disposal problem: "with a pastille, you don't need to leave it somewhere like with the chewing gum. Move on to kissing immediately, then that would be very helpful" (lines 377-378)

## CONCEPT 2: Clean Feel (lines 382-434)

**Concept Description** (lines 382-386)
- "A fresh and clean feeling in your mouth wherever you are"
- Claims to have gentle massaging feeling
- Textured/rough surface for cleaning effect

### Initial Reactions: Over-promising (lines 384-391)

**Sounds Strong But Questionable** (lines 384-386)
- "It feels like that would be very strong and effective... very forward"
- "Gentle and massaging feeling that I wonder how much you need to work to help you gently clean your mouth"

**Not Credible as Tooth Care** (lines 386-388)
- "I take care of my dental healthcare myself with the proper tools. Pastilles are not really intended for that purpose, I don't think"
- "We usually don't have pastilles specifically to clean our mouths"

**Toothbrush Comparison Rejected** (lines 388-390)
- "It's also kind of like a toothbrush... I don't think it's credible"
- "It's interesting but it's not credible"
- "The same for me, I don't believe it"

### Texture Feature: Dish Tablet Association (lines 391-396)

**Negative Mental Image** (lines 393-395)
- "I immediately start thinking about the dishwashing tablets. Is it like that?"
- "You think of the ones where they're in the dishwasher and they dissolve with a rough texture"

**Texture Skepticism** (line 396)
- "I would assume that the rough texture immediately goes away once you start sucking on the pastel"
- If structural (not just surface): "then that could be the case"

### More Credibility Doubts (lines 397-406)

**Sounds Interesting But Promises Too Much** (lines 398-400)
- "It sounds interesting, but it promises quite a lot"
- "I don't believe that... gives any sort of comparable effect compared to brushing your teeth"

**Chewing Gum Would Be Better** (lines 401-405)
- "When a xylitol chewing gum probably does more than this kind of pastille"
- Reason: "because I'm sort of chewing on it and that's your saliva is also helping to sort of spread the effect"
- "Pastilles dissolve in your mouth fairly quickly. I don't believe that it's too long lasting"

**Consensus** (lines 406-407)
- "Does everyone think that it's in principle good, but it's not really, it's maybe a little bit over exaggerating?"
- "Or does anyone disagree?"

### Xylitol Not Differentiating (line 408)
- "Xylitol is already put everywhere, so this doesn't stand out because of that"

### What's Credible vs. Not (lines 410-416)

**Most Is Credible** (line 411)
- "Everything except the end of it"

**Except the Massaging Feel** (lines 412-413)
- "The gentle massaging feel? Yes, that was a bit funny"

**Textured Surface Acceptable** (lines 414-415)
- "There are definitely pastilles that have the sort of textured surface, so I don't see why this would be unusual"

### Potential Use Cases - If It Actually Worked (lines 417-434)

**Emergency Tooth Brushing Replacement** (lines 419-425)
- "If I have a really chaotic morning that I forget to brush my teeth, then if I could have a pastille that then actually saves my dental health, then that would be good, of course"
- But concern: "then the risk that becomes a habit, then I'm just having pastilles instead of brushing my teeth" (line 420)
- "As an emergency measure" (lines 424-425)

**After Meals** (lines 428-429)
- "Well, after a meal also"
- "Yes, same for me"

**Long Drives** (lines 430-433)
- "If I'm driving for a long time, I'm driving to Lapland, for example, then this might be a good thing also"
- "If I'm otherwise having a long break between brushing my teeth or eating something on the road, then this could work for that"

**Positioning Question** (lines 435-437)
- "So would this be your sort of number one pastille or something more specialized?"
- "Both, both" - mixed responses

## CONCEPT 3: Long Extreme Fresh (lines 440-489)

**Concept Description** (lines 440-441)
- "Long, extreme freshness that you can feel immediately and for a long time"
- Emphasis on mint/menthol, flavor explosions, quick + long-lasting

### Initial Reactions (lines 441-449)

**Wake-Up Effect** (lines 442-443)
- "I feel like if I hadn't gotten a lot of sleep, I feel like I could take this and it would sort of jolt me awake as well"
- Freshens breath AND energizes with "explosions of flavor"

**Contradiction: Quick + Long-lasting** (lines 445-448)
- "It says it's a quick solution, but then it says that it's also a very long-lasting effect. Does it last for the whole day, actually?"
- "That doesn't sound believable"
- "If it's for one hour, that's already very long"

**Flavor Explosions Mechanism** (lines 449-451)
- "I'm wondering how the juicy freshness flavor explosions actually work"
- "I've definitely had pastilles that do behave in that way. So the idea is not new"

### Credibility Assessment (lines 453-458)

**Recognize the Situation** (lines 454-455)
- "Do you recognize this kind of situation? Where you have an unpleasant taste in your mouth and then you want to have a quick effect but also a long-lasting effect"

**Would Be Nice But Not Credible** (lines 456-458)
- "It would be nice that I can have it quickly and then not deal with it for a long time and then have the long-lasting effect in my mouth without having the pastille in there"
- "But the whole day doesn't sound credible"

**Who Believed "Whole Day"?** (lines 458-460)
- "Who felt that it could be for the whole day if you have a pastille?"
- One person: "You got that feeling?"
- "No one else?"

### Marketing Perception (lines 461-463)

**Targets Younger Generation** (line 461)
- "Yes, the extreme freshness makes me feel like it's being sold to the younger generation"

**Marketing Text Not Decision Factor** (line 463)
- "I feel like I could buy this, but I'm certainly not making my purchase decision based on the marketing text in the end"

**Moderator Clarification** (lines 464-467)
- "Don't think of this as a marketing text, but this is the idea that you have a pastille that is a quick effect, but then also a long-lasting effect"
- "Well, it probably doesn't last long. But if it does, then of course that's very good"
- "Don't worry about the word choices, but looking at the idea"

### Usage Scenarios (lines 468-473)

**Occasional, Not Daily** (lines 469-470)
- "It's not something that I would want to have every day, but it's something I could have occasionally"
- "I would like to have this as part of my selection of a few different boxes"

**When No Eating/Drinking Expected** (lines 472-473)
- "If I, for example, know that I won't be eating or drinking something in a while, then I can have the freshness from this last for a long time"

### Appeal If It Works (lines 474-475)

**Interested But Skeptical** (line 474-475)
- "I think so, I don't find it too credible based on the text, but if it works this way then I would be interested"

**Why Not Credible** (lines 476-479)
- "Do you feel like no pastel can be long-lasting?"
- "I don't have, like deodorants advertise that as well, that it lasts for three days at a time, but it doesn't"
- "It's very rare that this kind of lip gloss or deodorant or anything product like that actually works like that"

### Product Experience Reference (line 479)
- "I've been having pastels for several decades, and I think I've gone through all the products on the market and none of them have been in the way that I have it in the morning that I'm still in the evening feeling like I'm so fresh"

### Defining "Long-lasting" (lines 482-488)

**Need to Know Duration** (line 482-483)
- "If it's actually long-lasting, I would like to know how long the effect is"
- "I want to have it last until I'm having a meal"

**One Hour = Long-lasting** (lines 484-488)
- "For me, an hour would be nice to have for the long-lasting effect"
- "I'm sure no one is expecting it to be three days"
- Confirmed: "So one hour would be good. So that would be your expectation of the long-lasting effect"

## Cross-Concept Insights

### Credibility Issues Across All Three
1. **Quick Mint**: Too small to be long-lasting and dissolve quickly
2. **Clean Feel**: Can't replace tooth brushing, texture gimmick
3. **Long Extreme Fresh**: "Whole day" claim not believable

### What Would Make Concepts More Credible

**Quick Mint** (lines 366-370)
- Emphasize density/concentration
- Explain how small size can still be effective

**Clean Feel** (lines 417-434)
- Position as emergency/occasional substitute, not daily replacement
- Focus on post-meal and long-drive use cases

**Long Extreme Fresh** (lines 482-488)
- Define "long-lasting" specifically (1 hour seems credible)
- Don't claim "all day"
- Use realistic timeframes

### Product Portfolio Thinking Emerges
- Participants want multiple products for different situations (line 470)
- "Part of my selection of a few different boxes"
- Different products for different occasions rather than one ideal product
