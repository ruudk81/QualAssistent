# Topic 7: Ranking - Concepts + Packs + Brand
**Group:** Finland Group 1
**Transcript:** transcript_groep1_FI.txt
**Lines:** 749-834

## Overview
Participants ranked the three concepts (Quick Mint, Clean Feel, Long Extreme Fresh) with their respective packages and discussed preferences. Written exercise also asked them to evaluate packaging options labeled G (dispenser) and H (hex with tabs), then match packages to concepts.

## Initial Concept Ranking Discussion (lines 749-787)

**Three Concepts Reviewed** (lines 749-750)
- Quick Mint (quick and dirty)
- Clean Feel
- Long Extreme Fresh

### Quick Mint: Not First Choice (lines 752-769)

**General Skepticism** (lines 755-757)
- "I think we're a little bit skeptical about it"
- "We're a little bit skeptical about how well it works"
- Reasons: Haven't tried the box, unsure how well dispenser works, durability concerns

**As a Concept** (lines 758-760)
- When asked about the promises/text rather than just package
- "Well, maybe this would be easier to get one into my mouth rather than the other boxes where I would might need two hands for it"

**One-handed Advantage** (lines 761-763)
- "With this, I would like to have if I use the dispenser, I would expect to just get the one and then I can get it into my mouth with just one hand very quickly. That's an advantage"
- But: "that does require very good design on the box"

**Not Ranked #1 by Anyone** (lines 765-767)
- "Out of these three concepts that you've seen, you saw both the contents and the box. Does anyone feel the quick mint was the best one out of them?"
- "No?" - universal
- "The contents and the box"

### Clean Feel: Winner (lines 770-787)

**Moderator's Framing** (lines 768-772)
- "If you go to the grocery store and quick mint is this kind of quick pastel, it's on this clickable dispenser, you can quickly get one into your mouth. Or was it the clean fresh? With the cleaning, Xylitol pastilles"
- "Or... the long extreme which would keep you fresh for longer but also have the very quick effect"

**First Vote** (lines 773-774)
- "I think the middle one would be the best"
- Clean Fresh gets first vote

**Consensus Builds** (lines 775-780)
- "Okay. So you think clean fresh gets one vote?"
- "I think I would agree with that"
- "For clean, I think so"

**Why Clean Feel?** (lines 780-782)
- "These ones are also fun as ideas, but I think in practice, I feel like the plastic one is the safest or most reliable"
- "I think it's pretty reliable looking"
- Focus on reliability of execution rather than concept novelty

**Durability** (line 782)
- "I think the plastic one would stay, it would break less easily than the others"
- Exception: "but not the free sample one I would not choose"

### Hygiene Factor (lines 783-787)

**Most Hygienic** (line 784)
- "This is the most hygienic, the little cardboard one"

**Why?** (lines 785-786)
- "Because you only need to push on it and then you can pour some out"

**But: Pouring Control Issue** (line 786-787)
- "That hole is pretty big in that one, so maybe you can have too many when you pour it out, but that's a common problem"

## Written Exercise Results (lines 788-834)

**Exercise Explanation** (lines 788-802)
- Fill out forms individually
- All fresh pastille concepts shown
- **Task 1**: Choose favorite package type from options shown (line 791)
  - Mark letter and give brief justifications
  - G = dispenser type (not the one tried)
  - H = tabs version (hex with tabs)
- **Task 2**: Match packages to concepts (line 800-801)
  - Quick mint, clean feel, long extreme freshness, triple freshness
  - Which packages work best with which concepts?
- **Additional task**: Product tasting while working (lines 803-809)

### Package Preference Results (lines 816-834)

**Vote Distribution**
- E (Echo): 2 votes (lines 817-819)
- H (Hex with tabs): 4 votes (lines 822-827)

**Why H (Hex with Tabs)?** (lines 829-833)

*Recyclability* (line 830)
- "I think it's easier to recycle"
- "It's only plastic"

*Doesn't Open Accidentally* (line 832)
- "I think you don't easily open it"

*Capacity* (lines 832-833)
- "And I think you can get enough pastilles in this pastille as in the other big ones"

### Why E (Echo - Cardboard)?** (lines 837-839)

**Easy to Imagine Functionality** (line 839)
- "I can easily imagine how it would work"

## Product Tasting Reactions (lines 840-894)

**Two Products Tested**
- Blue package (first)
- Red package (second)

### First Product (Blue) - Mixed Reception (lines 841-851)

**Cardboard Flavor** (line 841)
- "It's a little bit of a cardboard flavor"

**Doesn't Make Impression** (line 844)
- "It doesn't really make an impression"

**Try Second One** (lines 845-847)
- "What about this one? You can try it"
- "Did anyone like the previous one?"

**Too Strong for Some** (lines 848-851)
- "I think it's a little bit strong. I'm not sure if I had the same one"
- Confirming: "That was the blue package"
- "And is this the red one? Yes, this is the red package now"

### Second Product (Red) - Preferred (lines 852-894)

**Better/Fresher** (lines 854-856)
- "What do you think about this? This one is better?"
- "Okay. This is fresher"

**Nose Effect** (lines 857-858)
- "I can feel it in my nose a little"
- "It's not too strong, but it has an effect. It's pleasant"

**More Flavor** (lines 860-864)
- "Who preferred this one? This definitely has more flavor"
- "And if I had a sore throat, I think this would open up my airways a little"
- "And especially if I'm having a cough, then this would reduce the hoarseness"

**Side Flavor Noted** (lines 864-866)
- "Yes, it has a stronger side flavor as well"
- "It's a little bit of a soap flavor, I think"
- Mechanism speculation: "there is something that makes you sweet. I'm not sure if that's a thing"

**Vote: Second Preferred** (lines 869-877)
- "Which of you preferred the second? Hands up"
- "I'm not sure. Why did you prefer this?"
- "I think it's much fresher"
- "Maybe the second is better"
- Comparison: "I think both had the feeling that I felt cold, the coldness in the nose. But the first was milder and the second also had more taste. It has more variance"

### Product Form/Shape (lines 879-894)

**Appearance/Shape Good** (lines 879-881)
- "Otherwise, if you think about the appearance, the shape, was it good?"
- "Yes, I think so"

**Would Work in Hex Jar** (lines 881-882)
- "So if it came along with this, I think it was served in the hex jar, and it was shaped like this, would it be good?"
- "Yes, yes, yes, yes"

**Size Concerns** (lines 883-886)
- "I think if you put it into this box, if you put the very smallest shapes, then it would be too small. I would want it to be a little bit bigger"
- "And if you have the bigger ones like this, then I would be concerned that you can only fit maybe five into that box"

**First vs Second Product** (lines 886-887)
- "And the first one was very boring, and the second one is very fresh, even though it has a bit of that side flavor to it"
- "But I think the freshness is very good"

**Eucalyptus Speculation** (lines 888-890)
- "Yes, maybe it has eucalyptus"
- "It has some sort of green flavor or plant-based flavor in it. It's not just the usual"

**Overall Acceptance** (lines 892-893)
- "Okay, so you like this fine?"
- "Okay, yes"

## Key Ranking Insights

### Concept Hierarchy
1. **Clean Feel** (Winner)
   - Most reliable packaging
   - Practical/functional
   - Won't break easily
   - Hygienic dispensing

2. **Long Extreme Fresh** (Second)
   - Package fits concept well
   - Appropriate for occasional use

3. **Quick Mint** (Last)
   - Fun idea but skeptical about execution
   - Durability concerns
   - None ranked it first

### Decision Drivers

**Reliability Over Innovation** (lines 780-782)
- "These ones are also fun as ideas, but I think in practice..."
- Prefer proven, safe execution to novel concepts
- Willing to sacrifice excitement for dependability

**Hygiene Matters** (lines 783-787)
- Pour-out mechanism seen as most hygienic
- Minimize touching pastilles

**Practical Concerns Trump Concept Appeal**
- Even if Quick Mint addresses real need (last-minute freshening)
- Execution worries override conceptual fit
- Need confidence it will work consistently

### Package Preference Patterns

**H (Hex with tabs) Won** - 4 votes
- Recyclability
- Security (won't open accidentally)
- Good capacity
- Proven format

**E (Cardboard) - 2 votes**
- Familiar/can imagine how it works
- Simplicity

**Dispenser (G)** - 0 votes in final count
- Concerns never resolved
- Too uncertain about mechanism

### Product Tasting Impact

**Second Product (Red) Clearly Preferred**
- Fresher, more effective
- Right level of strength (not too mild, not too strong)
- Cooling effect in nose
- Would work for sore throat/cough
- Has "variance"/complexity of flavor

**First Product (Blue) Failed**
- Cardboard flavor
- Doesn't make impression
- Too mild/boring

**Implications**
- Product performance matters most (confirmed again)
- "Very fresh" = cooling nose sensation + flavor complexity
- Mild = boring/ineffective
- Some side flavor (soap/eucalyptus) acceptable if fresh enough

### Match Between Tasting and Concept Preferences

**Clean Feel Won Concept Ranking**
- Promises dental health, cleaning, effectiveness

**Red Product Won Tasting**
- Delivers freshness, strength, effectiveness
- "Opens up airways"
- "Reduces hoarseness"

**Alignment**: Want products that deliver functional benefits, not just pleasant taste
- Health benefits (dental, throat soothing) valued
- Effectiveness > enjoyment
- Multi-functional preferred
