# Topic 3: Trade-offs for the "Ideal" Mint/Pastille
**Group:** Finland Group 1
**Transcript:** transcript_groep1_FI.txt
**Lines:** 236-315

## Overview
This section explored how participants balance different product attributes when choosing pastilles. A clear theme emerged: **context matters more than absolute preferences** - participants wanted different attributes for different situations.

## Long-lasting vs. Quick Dissolving (lines 237-246)

**Preference: Long-lasting** (lines 237-242)
- "Slow" - agreed by multiple participants
- Universal initial preference for slow dissolving

**But Context-Dependent** (lines 243-246)
- "Depends on the situation a little. Sometimes I would like to have quick dissolving" (lines 243-244)
- Customer meeting scenario: "If I just want to continue speaking... then it's annoying to have a slow dissolving pastille in my mouth" (line 245)
- Focus/calming use: "If I'm using it for my focus, as I described earlier, then a slow dissolving one would be better" (line 246)

## Size: Big vs. Small (lines 247-259)

**No Clear Preference - Highly Variable** (lines 247-248)
- "That varies quite a lot as well"

**Small = Unpleasant** (lines 249-251)
- "The small one is something that's the size of an allergy medication. I'm not sure if that's nice to eat"
- "For most of the pastilles, the small ones are not fun"

**Size Depends On...** (lines 252-259)
- Flavor strength: "It also depends on how strong the flavor is" (line 252)
- Pastille type: "That depends also on the type of pastille" (line 254)
- Dissolving speed: "also on how fast it dissolves" (line 257)
- Both sizes have their place: "both of them have their places" (line 258)

**Key Trade-off Articulated** (line 255)
- "We were talking about the long lasting effect or the flavor or a more stronger flavor... it could be better with that is faster dissolving, but it's very difficult to choose an absolute better one out of these"

## Sucking vs. Chewing (lines 260-268)

**Again: Context-Dependent** (line 261)
- "Again, it depends"

**When to Suck** (lines 262-266)
- "When I want to have it rolling around my mouth for a long time and just letting it happen" (line 263)
- For focus: "when you're using it for a focus, then it's better to have it be the suckable type" (line 264)
- Duration: "because it lasts longer" (line 265)

**When to Chew** (line 263)
- "Chewables are easier to break up so that it's fun to eat while chewing"

**Against Chewing** (lines 266-268)
- Strong preference from at least one participant: "I also prefer it to be sucked on. I don't want to have the chewable"
- Reason: "it leaves a sort of dust in my mouth when it disintegrates when you chew on it. That's annoying" (lines 267-268)

## Strong/Intense vs. Gentle/Comfortable (lines 270-276)

**Varies By Pastille** (line 272)
- "That depends on the pastel again"

**Individual Preferences**
- Gentle preference: "maybe I would prefer the gentle and comfortable one" (line 272)
- Middle ground: "I would be somewhere in the middle" (line 273)
- Lean toward strong: "Typically, I would say that most of the time I'm looking for a strong effect that's maybe 60-40 on the ratio" (line 275)

**Both Are Pleasant** (line 276)
- "Both are pleasant, but again, it depends"

## Sweet/Candy-like vs. Natural/Clean Taste (lines 277-282)

**Preference: Natural/Clean** (lines 279-281)
- "Both are fine"
- "Maybe I would prefer it to have the natural and clean taste because it leans on the freshness of my breath more"
- "More the clean taste" (line 281)

**Sweet = No Mint** (line 282)
- "Usually if you have the sweet pastilles, they usually don't have mint in them, because that would take it in the other direction"
- Implies mint is associated with clean/fresh rather than sweet

## Visible vs. Discreet/Silent (lines 283-288)

**Preference: Discreet** (line 284)
- "I would prefer it to be discreet"

**Visibility Confusion** (lines 285-286)
- Question about what "visible" means
- "It has to be pretty big if you want to actually have it be visible while you're chewing on it"

**Package vs. Pastille Visibility** (lines 287-288)
- Package can be visible: "if you're downing the whole box, then it's definitely more visible"
- Individual pastille not visible: "if you're having it one pastille at a time, then it's probably not visible regardless of what it looks like"

## Price Trade-offs (lines 289-299)

**Three Options Presented:**
1. Lower price + more sustainability
2. Lower price + better dental care effects
3. Lower price + more premium feel

**Dental Care Wins** (lines 294-295)
- "I think the dental care I would happily pay a little bit more for"
- "Agreed, agreed, agreed" - universal agreement

**Sustainability Loses** (lines 296-297)
- "But I don't particularly care about the sustainability in this context"
- "But otherwise I don't particularly think about them"

**Brand Loyalty Over Price** (lines 297-299)
- "I just usually have the specific brand I'm going for and then if it's lower price that's fine and if it's better, more sustainable that's also fine"
- "But for the dental care I would be willing to pay a little bit more extra"

## Cooling Kick vs. Smooth/Soothing Feel (lines 300-309)

**Mixed Preferences** (lines 302-307)
- "Sometimes yes, sometimes not. This may be a 50-60 split" (line 303)
- "Somewhere in the middle also" (line 305)
- "I would like it to be a little bit soothing but also to have some kind of cooling feel" (line 306)

**Slight Lean Toward Cooling** (line 307)
- "Maybe more often I'm looking for a cooling kick than a soothing or smooth feeling, but maybe probably somewhere in between usually"

**When Cooling Especially Important** (line 308-309)
- "The cooling kick is something that would be particularly good when I'm down with the flu"
- "Looking for something to ease up my nose and mouth a little bit and open up the airways, but depends on the situation again"

## Sugar vs. Sugar-free (lines 310-314)

**Universal Preference: Sugar-free** (lines 311-312)
- "Sugar-free, everyone?"
- "Yes, sugar-free"

**Xylitol Association** (line 313)
- "And if it's xylitol..." - mentioned again, reinforcing dental health connection

## Most Important Factors (lines 315-318)

**Multiple Factors Sought Simultaneously** (lines 316-317)
- "I usually look for a lot of those at the same time"
- No single dominant attribute - constellation of features matters

## Key Insights

1. **Context is king**: Nearly every trade-off was answered with "it depends on the situation"

2. **Multiple products needed**: Participants don't want one "ideal" pastille - they want different products for different occasions
   - Quick for customer meetings
   - Slow for focus/calming
   - Strong for breath freshening
   - Gentle for post-meal dental care

3. **Non-negotiables identified:**
   - Sugar-free (universal)
   - Dental care worth paying more (universal)
   - Small sizes are unpleasant (strong consensus)
   - Sustainability not a priority (explicit statement)

4. **Personal variation accepted**: Participants comfortable saying they differ from each other on many attributes (strong/gentle, cooling/soothing)

5. **Form follows function**: Product attributes should match use case
   - Long-lasting = infrequent dispensing package appropriate
   - Quick effect = easy one-handed access important
   - Focus/calming = slow dissolving, suckable
   - Professional situations = quick dissolving to allow speaking

6. **Brand loyalty moderate**: Some people have preferred brands but not rigid about it; quality and features can override
