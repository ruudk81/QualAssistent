**Group:** Finland Group 1
**Transcript:** transcript_groep1_FI.txt
**Lines:** 840-894 (product test integrated in ranking), 895-957 (wrap-up)

## Overview
Session concluded with product testing (tasted two pastilles), final advice to developers, and closing. Session ran over the planned 2 hours.

## Product Testing (lines 840-894)
*Note: Product tasting was integrated into the ranking exercise (Topic 7) rather than as a separate closing activity*

### Products Tested
- **First product** (blue package) - lines 841-851
- **Second product** (red package) - lines 852-894

### First Product (Blue Package): Rejected

**Flavor Issues** (lines 841-844)
- "It's a little bit of a cardboard flavor" (line 841)
- "It doesn't really make an impression" (line 844)

**Too Strong for Some** (lines 848-851)
- "I think it's a little bit strong"
- Mixed reactions suggest inconsistent product experience

### Second Product (Red Package): Strongly Preferred

**Positive Attributes** (lines 854-858)
- "This is fresher" (line 856)
- "I can feel it in my nose a little" (line 857)
- "It's not too strong, but it has an effect. It's pleasant" (line 858)

**More Flavor & Effectiveness** (lines 860-864)
- "This definitely has more flavor" (line 861)
- "If I had a sore throat, I think this would open up my airways a little" (lines 862-863)
- "If I'm having a cough, then this would reduce the hoarseness" (line 863)

**Side Flavor Noted But Acceptable** (lines 864-866, 888-890)
- "It has a stronger side flavor as well. It's a little bit of a soap flavor" (lines 864-865)
- Speculation: "Maybe it has eucalyptus... some sort of green flavor or plant-based flavor in it. It's not just the usual" (lines 888-890)
- Side flavor acceptable because freshness is strong enough

**Comparison Summary** (lines 875-878)
- "Both had the feeling that I felt cold, the coldness in the nose"
- "But the first was milder and the second also had more taste"
- "It has more variance" (line 878)

**Verdict** (lines 886-887, 892-893)
- "The first one was very boring, and the second one is very fresh, even though it has a bit of that side flavor to it"
- "The freshness is very good"
- "You like this fine? Okay, yes"

### Product Form Evaluation (lines 879-886)

**Shape Acceptable** (lines 879-882)
- "If you think about the appearance, the shape, was it good? Yes, I think so"
- "If it came along with this... in the hex jar, and it was shaped like this, would it be good? Yes, yes, yes, yes"

**Size Concerns Remain** (lines 883-886)
- "If you put the very smallest shapes, then it would be too small. I would want it to be a little bit bigger"
- "And if you have the bigger ones like this, then I would be concerned that you can only fit maybe five into that box"
- Balance needed between pastille size and package capacity

## Wrap-up: Final Advice to Developers (lines 895-929)

### Session Closing (line 895)
- "And now we are actually already – our two hours are up"

**Question to Participants** (lines 896-899)
- "As a closing comment, for those people who are thinking about the past sales and the development, what to put in them, what to do with them, what would you want?"
- "You have three comments here. What do you want to say to the developers? What do you want to see in the grocery stores?"

### Advice #1: Package Functionality & Hygiene (lines 900-902)

**Easy Dispensing** (line 900)
- "I want the packages to be easy, that I can easily dispense them out of them"

**Hygienic** (line 900)
- "And to be hygienic so that I don't need to touch the pastilles"

**Sturdy** (line 902)
- "And that it's also sturdy so that they don't accidentally open or they don't break"

### Advice #2: Prioritize Product Over Package (lines 903-908)

**Investment Priority** (line 903-904)
- "I think I would invest first in the pastilles and second in the packages"

**What Makes Perfect Pastille** (lines 904-908)
- "What would be the perfect pastille for you?"
- "It has the freshness that it is, unless it's for the other purposes. But for freshening the breath, then this red one was effective"
- "And it also opens up my nose as well"
- "And if it works long, then it would be similar to the long stream" [long extreme fresh]

**Multi-benefit Desired:**
1. Freshness (like red product tested)
2. Opens airways/nose
3. Long-lasting effect

### Advice #3: One-handed Dispensing (lines 911-912)

**Convenience Critical** (line 911)
- "It's good if you can use the box with one hand"
- "And if you can dispense it directly into your mouth so that you don't need to help it with your other hand and you don't need to reach into the box"

### Advice #4: New Flavors Requested (lines 913-926)

**Innovation Request** (line 913-915)
- "I think we have had pastilles like this for a long time"
- "Would it be possible to have the same properties but maybe find some new flavors?"

**Flavor Suggestions** (lines 914-921)
- "Like if they had a bit of a hint of chili or something like that, some sort of jalapeno on it"
- "But some sort of new flavor because we have all seen these flavors. Everyone's seen all these flavors already"
- "If they can find six new flavors of long drinks every year, why not for these pastilles?"
- Must still have freshening effect (line 917-918)
- Other suggestions: "Maybe raspberry" (line 920)
- "You can try any kind of flavor" (line 921)

**Flavor Variety Problem** (lines 922-924)
- "I have many different types of boxes that have just the same flavors, then I get bored of them"
- "And the freshness is always the same"
- "I would like to have different flavors that I can rotate through if it still has the freshness, but it has new flavors"

**Flavor Exclusion** (line 926)
- "But not coriander"

### No Additional Comments (lines 927-929)
- "Anything else? Nope"
- Moderator checks back room: "I will also check the back room to see if we have anything to add"

## Session Conclusion (lines 947-957)

**Over Time** (line 948)
- "Then sorry, we're already over time"

**Thank You & Compensation** (lines 948-957)
- "But thank you very much for your participation"
- Gift cards discussion (lines 949-956)
- "Make sure you have a 50 and a 10" (line 955)
- "And you're now released. And thank you that you have the energy to keep going" (line 956-957)

## Key Themes from Wrap-up

### Product Performance is Paramount
**Repeated throughout session:**
- "Contents is the most important part" (Topic 6)
- "I just care about the content" (Topic 5)
- "Invest first in the pastilles and second in the packages" (line 903)

**What "perfect pastille" means:**
1. Effective freshness (cooling, nose opening)
2. Multi-functional (breath, dental, throat)
3. Long-lasting effect
4. Interesting/varied flavors

### Package Must Be Functional, Not Novel
**Non-negotiables:**
- Won't spill/break
- One-handed use
- Hygienic (minimal touching)
- Direct-to-mouth dispensing

**Nice-to-haves:**
- Sustainability
- Premium feel
- Novel mechanisms

### Flavor Innovation Urgently Needed
**Current State:** Bored with same flavors across all brands
**Comparison:** Long drinks get 6 new flavors/year, why not pastilles?
**Requirements for new flavors:**
- Must still freshen breath
- Can be adventurous (chili, jalapeño)
- Provide rotation/variety
- Avoid: coriander

### Multi-functional Products Valued
Participants want pastilles that:
- Freshen breath
- Support dental health (xylitol)
- Soothe sore throat
- Open airways when congested
- Provide calming/focus aid
- Combat dry mouth

Single-benefit products seen as limited/boring

### Credibility Through Execution
- Ideas are "fun" but must be reliably executed
- Prefer proven formats to innovative-but-risky mechanisms
- Need to try/test before believing claims
- Real product examples (like Frisk) validate concepts

## Product Testing Key Learnings

**Effective = Multisensory**
- Feel it in nose (cooling)
- Taste complexity ("variance")
- Physical sensation (opens airways)
- Not just mouth freshness

**Mild = Boring/Ineffective**
- "Doesn't make an impression"
- "Cardboard flavor"
- First product failed because too mild

**Strong BUT Pleasant**
- Second product: "not too strong, but it has an effect"
- Side flavors (soap/eucalyptus) acceptable if overall fresh
- Balance between intensity and pleasantness

**Functional Benefits > Pure Taste**
- Preferred product for sore throat, cough, opening airways
- Health benefits explicitly valued
- Not just about enjoyment, about effectiveness
