# Topic 8: The Alternative - Triple Freshness
**Group:** Finland Group 1
**Transcript:** transcript_groep1_FI.txt
**Lines:** N/A

## Overview
This topic was not covered in the Finland Group 1 transcript. According to the discussion guide, this section should introduce a "Triple Freshness" alternative concept to evaluate whether it's different and more attractive than previous concepts.

## Status
**NOT PRESENT IN TRANSCRIPT**

The session appears to have moved directly from ranking exercises (Topic 7) to pack alternatives and product testing (Topics 9-10), skipping the Triple Freshness concept introduction.

## Possible Explanations
1. Time constraints - session was running long (moderator mentions being over time at line 895)
2. Concept not ready for this market/group
3. Sequencing variation - may have been integrated elsewhere
4. Removed from Finland sessions

## Impact on Analysis
When comparing across groups, note that Finland Group 1 did not evaluate the Triple Freshness concept, so cross-group comparisons on this topic will not include FI Group 1 data.
