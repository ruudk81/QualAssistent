# Topic 5: Unbranded Packs
**Group:** Finland Group 1
**Transcript:** transcript_groep1_FI.txt
**Lines:** 491-652

## Overview
Participants evaluated three packaging concepts without branding - all hexagonal disc shapes made from plant-based plastic. The focus was on functionality, convenience, and how well the package matched the product concept.

## PACKAGE 1: Quick Mint - Clickable Dispenser (lines 493-553)

**Package Description** (lines 497-504)
- Small hexagonal disc
- Plant-based plastic
- Clickable dispenser mechanism with red tab
- One pastille dispensed at a time
- "Like a sort of dosing candy dispenser" (line 505)
- 3D printed prototype shown (line 502)

### Initial Reactions

**Looks Work-in-Progress** (lines 508-512)
- "I look at the package and I use sometimes these sort of dispenser packages, but I get the... it looks a little bit like a work in progress"
- "I know it's just a mock-up design, it would probably have a brand and so forth"
- "I think the idea is good"

**Like the Clickable Dispenser** (line 513)
- "I like the clickable dispenser"

### Major Concerns: Durability (lines 513-514, 519-522)

**Breakability** (line 513-514)
- "But I wonder how long it would last. It feels like they're very easy to break"

**Won't Spill** (line 519)
- "In general, I like that the package seems like something that it won't spill in your handbag immediately"

**Must Work Well** (lines 519-522)
- "But of course, it also has to work well, that you can actually easily dispense one of the pastilles while you're driving a car, for example"
- "And also that you don't need to have two hands shaking it open over myself. I can just click it once and have one pastille"

### Size Criticism (line 516)
- "Regardless, I don't like the size, it's too small"

### One-Handed Use (lines 527-531)

**Direct to Mouth?** (lines 527-531)
- "Can I click it directly into my mouth? That I don't need to click it into my hand first?"
- "Yes, probably. I could just do it with one hand into my mouth"
- Uncertainty: "I'm not sure if it might spill somewhere, but the idea is good"

### Environmental Concerns (lines 532-538)

**Refillable Bags?** (lines 532-534)
- "I would focus on the packaging and then maybe also have these sorts of refillable bags"
- "If I spent more of these, then I would have a lot of these little dispenser boxes in my trash"

**Refills Would Be Good** (line 534)
- "If you're looking for the environmental friendliness, then that would be a good idea to have the box and have it be refillable"

**Not Essential** (lines 536-538)
- "OK, so if you have the idea, what if it doesn't have refillable bags? If it's just the plastic like this?"
- "That's fine too. It wouldn't really change my purchase decision, I don't think"

### Plant-based Plastic (lines 540-545)

**Not Worth Premium** (lines 543-544)
- "I wouldn't want to pay extra for having specifically the clickable dispenser that's more sustainable"
- "I would want to more focus on the contents, the pastel itself"
- "The package, environmental friendliness of the package is not the deciding factor for me"

**Same Price = Would Buy** (lines 546-548)
- "Let's assume that it's the same price as all the competitors, but then it has this nice clickable dispenser"
- "I think that then I would be willing to buy it, but it would also depend on what I already have in my bag"
- "If I have to have no pastels and I'm buying for one, then that would be a great choice"

### Content Over Package (lines 549-553)
- "For me also, the box doesn't matter at all. I just care about the content" (line 549-550)
- Moderator: "Well, unfortunately, we'll be talking about the boxes for the rest of the day" (line 551)
- Participant: "Yes, that's fine, but I just wanted to express that" (line 552)

## PACKAGE 2: Clean Feel - Dual Tab System (lines 554-611)

**Package Description** (lines 554-560)
- Hexagonal disc
- Two tabs: small tab and large tab
- Physical prototype provided for participants to try
- Moderator: "I didn't mention separately because it had the clicking dispenser" - acknowledging previous package (line 558)

### Reactions to Dual Tab Design

**Why Two Tabs?** (line 562)
- "I wonder why it has to be too..." - questioning the need for two

**Easy Reclosable** (line 563)
- "I like that it easily reclosable"

**Small Tab Preferred** (lines 564-565)
- "I think with this kind of tab, you can quickly flip it open with your thumb and get one out"

**Sharing Behavior** (lines 565-567)
- "If I'm sharing it with friends, I would probably still open just a small tab and then pour it onto people's hands that way"
- Alternative: "It has the top of the lid that you can pour a few of them out into and then offer people pastilles from that" (line 566)

**Positive on Plastic Feel** (line 568)
- "I do like the feel of this plastic package"

**Only Want Small Tab** (lines 569-571)
- "I would prefer it with just one tab. Just a small one or a big one?"
- "Just the one small tab"
- Can pour into friend's hand if sharing (line 573)

### Big Tab Problem (line 576)
- "And the bigger tab, you can clearly see that it's too big"

### Design Improvements (lines 577-584)

**Pastille Size Matching** (lines 578-584)
- "What kind of pastille would you like to have inside it? Something that's easy to pour out"
- "If it's that size of a tab, then it can't be too small. I would want to mainly be able to pour one out at a time"
- Size inside prototype might be wrong: "it might be of a wrong size, because when you pack it full, then it, of course, it needs to be a little bit smaller so that it can actually squeeze out"

### Package-Concept Fit (lines 585-597)

**Does Package Affect Interest in Clean Feel Concept?** (lines 585-588)
- "Does this package affect how interesting you find the clean feel concept?"
- "Yes?" - nodding agreement
- "Why? Well, I still want to know how well it works, the packaging"

**Packaging Importance** (lines 592-593)
- "Does anyone else find the packaging important or equally important?"

**Size-to-Fill Ratio** (lines 593-594)
- "The packaging is important when if it's this size and it's full, depending on how full it is when you buy it, the size of the packaging and the size of the pastel, which should change"
- "But if you have a huge package and it's filled just with air and a few pastilles, then I feel scammed when I buy it"

**Doesn't Matter Which Material** (lines 595-596)
- "That doesn't matter whether it's a cardboard or plastic or whether it's a box or a disc"
- Key requirement: "I just wanted to have the lid stay closed so that they don't spill into my bag. That is very important"

### Clean Feel Concept Interest (lines 598-606)

**Most Interesting of Three** (lines 599-600)
- "Who felt that the clean feel... was interesting out of these three?"
- "I would say it's the most interesting out of these three"

**Cleanness + Dental Health Appeal** (line 600)
- "I also like when it mentions the cleanness, the dental health"

**Package Doesn't Make It Fresher** (lines 600-601)
- "And if it also comes in this kind of package, does that make it fresher?"
- "No, not really. But I think it would be functional"

**Skip Bigger Tab** (line 603)
- "I think you could skip the bigger tab and just have the smaller tab"

**Fits Clean Feel Content** (line 604)
- "So you feel like it would fit the clean field content well?"

### Dispenser vs. Tab Preference (lines 605-611)

**Prefer Dispenser Concept** (line 605-606)
- "Yes, I think I would prefer the first concept with the dispenser"

**Prefer Tabs** (line 607)
- "Who prefers the tabs over the dispensers?"

**Depends on How Dispenser Works** (line 608-609)
- "It depends a little bit on how the dispenser works. I would want to try it first"

**Menton-style Vertical Tab** (line 610)
- "I think I would prefer to have something closer to the Menton vertical tab structure"

**Dispenser Over Medication Box** (line 611)
- "But I think I would overall prefer this kind of dispenser over to the medication box"

## PACKAGE 3: Long Extreme Fresh - Tab System (lines 612-652)

**Package Description** (lines 612-615)
- Same opening mechanism as Clean Feel (tab system)
- For the long-lasting freshness concept

### Noise Concern (lines 616-618)
- "How empty these boxes are, how much more noise they make when you use them"
- "So this would maybe be more discreet" - when fuller

### Package-Concept Fit (lines 619-626)

**Good Fit for Long-lasting** (lines 621-624)
- "I think the idea of long-lasting effect supports this, because this box is clearly made for just taking the one and then the effect lasts you for a long time until you want to have the next one"
- "So it feels like it's good that it would be this kind of a..."

**Package Supports Concept** (line 624)
- "I feel like the package itself genuinely supports the concept of the contents"

**Occasional Access = Less Convenient Package Okay** (lines 625-626)
- "Where if it's just the sort of classic box, then you'll usually just have it very easy to access"
- "So I would want to be picking one out every now and then, but the long-lasting one should be in the box where it's a little bit less convenient, and I would want to have one only occasionally"

### Color Coding Request (lines 627-629)
- "I would maybe just want color coding on the package to know what I have inside them"
- "If I have multiple products with the same package, of course, I would like to have it branded"
- Agreement: "I think they would be color coded and branded separately"

### Design Perception (lines 631-650)

**Not Modern** (lines 631-640)
- "And this kind of package, does it communicate something in terms of a modern design or...?"
- "No, not really. I've seen packages like this before"
- "I think more about the 80s when I see it"
- "It's maybe more old-fashioned than retro"

**Who Finds It New/Different?** (lines 641-643)
- "Who feels this would be new and different?"
- "It's not new and wonderful, but it's a little bit different"
- "I'm so used to just the basic boxes for so many years... I was also surprised by the new Minfund package. That was also very interesting"

**Brand Image Implications** (lines 646-647)
- "I think this definitely is looking for a specific kind of brand image with the shape and the plastic"
- "But I think it does look a little bit retro in the positive and negative senses"

**Snus Confusion Concern** (lines 648-650)
- "Usually when we talk about things like snus tins, which are in a similar package, those are more round"
- "I don't use them myself, but there you can usually very clearly see who is using snus when they have it in their pocket"
- "So I wouldn't want that to be mistaken for a snus package"

**Shape Differentiation** (line 651-652)
- "Yes, it's a little bit angular, but it's about the same height"

## Key Package Evaluation Themes

### Functionality Priorities
1. **Must not spill in bag** (lines 519, 596)
2. **One-handed operation** (lines 519-522, 527-531)
3. **Easy to use while driving** (line 520)
4. **Lid must stay closed** (line 596)

### Durability Concerns
- Dispenser mechanism might break easily (lines 513-514)
- Need to actually try mechanisms to judge (line 608-609)

### Environmental Features
- Refillable nice but not essential (lines 532-538)
- Plant-based plastic not worth premium (lines 543-544)
- Won't pay extra for sustainable packaging (line 543)
- Content matters more than package sustainability (line 544)

### Package-Concept Matching
- **Long-lasting concept = less convenient access okay** (lines 621-626)
  - Makes sense to have mechanism that limits frequent access
  - Package reinforces the product promise
- **Quick effect = easy one-handed access critical** (lines 519-522)

### Design Perception
- Hexagonal shape seen as 80s/retro, not modern (lines 638-640)
- Risk of snus tin confusion (lines 648-650)
- Color coding essential if multiple products same shape (line 627)

### Social/Sharing Considerations
- Would still pour into friends' hands even with dispenser (lines 565-567)
- Lid top can serve as communal pouring surface (line 566)

### Content > Package Hierarchy
- Multiple statements that contents matter most (lines 549-550, 544)
- Package won't change purchase decision much (line 538)
- But package can support or undermine concept credibility (lines 621-624)
