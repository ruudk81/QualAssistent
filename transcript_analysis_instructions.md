# Focus Group Transcript Analysis Instructions

## Overview & Purpose

This document provides systematic instructions for analyzing focus group transcripts from the fresh pastilles/mints research study (Menthol brand in Sweden/Finland, Sportlife in Netherlands).

**Goal:** Create extensive, grounded summaries for each of the 10 discussion guide topics, organized in separate files to enable cross-group comparison by topic.

**Why separate files per topic?**
- Allows analysis across all groups for Topic 1, Topic 2, etc.
- Facilitates later country-level aggregation
- Makes findings more modular and accessible

## File Naming Convention

**Pattern:** `{COUNTRY}_{group#}_topic{##}_{topic_name}.md`

**Country Codes:**
- `FI` = Finland
- `SE` = Sweden
- `NL` = Netherlands

**Examples:**
- `FI_group1_topic01_introduction.md`
- `SE_group1_topic02_usage_attitudes.md`
- `NL_group2_topic04_concept_evaluation.md`

**Topic Numbers (always use 2 digits):**
- `topic01` through `topic10`

**Topic Names (short, descriptive):**
1. `introduction`
2. `usage_attitudes`
3. `tradeoffs`
4. `concept_evaluation`
5. `unbranded_packs`
6. `branded_packs`
7. `ranking`
8. `triple_freshness`
9. `pack_alternatives`
10. `wrapup_product_test`

## The 10 Discussion Guide Topics

Reference from `transcript topics v2.docx`:

1. **Introduction** - Opening, introductions, setting expectations
2. **Usage & Attitudes - General** - Current products, situations, brands, frustrations
3. **Trade-offs for "Ideal" Mint/Pastille** - Attribute preferences (size, speed, strength, etc.)
4. **Concept/Product Idea Evaluation (3x)** - Quick Mint, Clean Feel, Long Extreme Fresh
5. **Unbranded Packs** - Packaging without branding
6. **Branded Packs** - Same packaging with brand (Menton/Sportlife)
7. **Ranking - Concepts + Packs + Brand** - Preference ordering and discussion
8. **Triple Freshness Alternative** - New concept introduction
9. **Pack Alternatives - Physical Packaging** - Competitor/mock-up packages
10. **Wrap-up + Product Test** - Product tasting, final advice

## Template for Each Topic Summary

```markdown
# Topic [#]: [Topic Name]
**Group:** [Country] Group [#]
**Transcript:** [filename]
**Lines:** [start-end]

## Overview
[2-3 sentence summary of what this section covered]

## [Major Theme 1]
[Grounded discussion with quotes and line references]

**Key Quote** (line XX)
- "Direct quote from participant"

**Participant Reaction** (lines XX-XX)
- Summary with specific statements

## [Major Theme 2]
[Continue pattern...]

## Key Insights
1. **[Insight theme]**: [Description with supporting evidence]
2. **[Next theme]**: [Description]
[etc.]
```

## Guidelines for Grounded Analysis

### 1. Stay Grounded in Actual Statements
- **Do:** Use direct quotes with line numbers
- **Don't:** Interpret beyond what was said
- Work with what's in the transcript, even if messy/incomplete

**Example:**
```markdown
**Good:** "I think the dental care I would happily pay a little bit more for" (line 294)
**Bad:** Participants valued health benefits and were willing to invest in wellness
```

### 2. Use Line Number References
- Always cite line numbers for quotes: `(line XX)` or `(lines XX-XX)`
- Helps verify statements and locate context
- Critical for credibility and cross-checking

### 3. Capture Participant Voices
- Preserve actual language used
- Note when multiple participants agree ("universal agreement", "consensus")
- Show dissenting voices ("one participant disagreed")
- Track individual perspectives when relevant

### 4. Note Opinion Shifts
Track how attitudes change over discussion:
- **Initial reaction** → **After discussion** → **Final position**
- Example from FI Group 1: Quick Mint went from "not credible" → "ranked last" → "would be fine" (after seeing Frisk)

### 5. Distinguish Reactions
Mark participant reactions clearly:
- **Credible** vs. **Not credible**
- **Interested** vs. **Skeptical**
- **Positive** vs. **Negative** vs. **Mixed**
- **Universal** vs. **Individual** opinions

### 6. Multi-functional Insights
Capture:
- What they said (quote)
- Why they said it (reasoning)
- What it means (implication)
- Conditions/context (when/why this matters)

## Handling Common Challenges

### Challenge 1: Mixed Languages
**What:** Transcripts may have errors with wrong languages mixed in
**Solution:** Work with it - focus on meaning, note when unclear
**Example from FI Group 1:** Dutch phrases appeared in Finnish transcript

```markdown
"Ik gebruik ze omdat ze goede verpakkingen hebben" (line 108)
[Transcription error - Dutch in Finnish session]
Meaning: Uses them because they have good packaging
```

### Challenge 2: No Topic Headings
**What:** Transcripts don't have clear section breaks
**Solution:**
- Identify topic boundaries by content flow
- Use discussion guide as roadmap
- Look for moderator transitions ("Let's move on to...", "Next we have...")
- Mark approximate line ranges

### Challenge 3: Missing Topics
**What:** Some topics may not be covered in certain sessions
**Solution:** Create file noting topic was NOT COVERED

```markdown
# Topic 8: The Alternative - Triple Freshness
**Status:** NOT PRESENT IN TRANSCRIPT

[Brief explanation of what should have been covered]
[Note impact on cross-group analysis]
```

### Challenge 4: Integrated/Combined Topics
**What:** Topics may blend together (e.g., product testing during ranking)
**Solution:**
- Note where topic appears in file
- Cross-reference to other topics
- Capture content in most relevant topic file

**Example:**
```markdown
## Product Testing (lines 840-894)
*Note: Product tasting was integrated into the ranking exercise (Topic 7)
rather than as a separate closing activity*
```

### Challenge 5: Incomplete Information
**What:** Audio gaps, unclear statements, missing context
**Solution:**
- Note what's unclear: "[unclear]" or "[inaudible]"
- Work with available information
- Don't invent or assume
- Flag as limitation if critical

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing each topic file, verify:

- [ ] **Header complete:** Group, transcript name, line numbers included
- [ ] **Overview present:** 2-3 sentence summary of section
- [ ] **Grounded quotes:** Multiple direct quotes with line references
- [ ] **Themes organized:** Clear sub-headings for major themes
- [ ] **Participant voices:** Preserved actual language and perspectives
- [ ] **Credibility noted:** Marked what's believable vs. skeptical
- [ ] **Opinion shifts tracked:** Changes over discussion noted
- [ ] **Key insights section:** Summary of main findings at end
- [ ] **Cross-references:** Links to related topics if relevant
- [ ] **Conditions/context:** When opinions are situational, noted as such

## Process Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare
1. Have discussion guide (`transcript topics v2.docx`) open for reference
2. Identify transcript file to process
3. Read through entire transcript once to understand flow

### Step 2: Identify Topic Boundaries
1. Go through transcript systematically
2. Mark approximate line ranges for each of 10 topics
3. Note any missing or integrated topics
4. Create rough outline of where topics appear

### Step 3: Process Each Topic
For each of the 10 topics:
1. Re-read that section carefully
2. Identify major themes and patterns
3. Extract key quotes with line numbers
4. Note reactions (credible/skeptical, positive/negative)
5. Track opinion shifts if present
6. Capture individual vs. group perspectives

### Step 4: Write Summary File
1. Use template structure (header, overview, themes, insights)
2. Write extensive grounded content with quotes
3. Add line number references throughout
4. Create Key Insights section summarizing main findings
5. Review against quality checklist

### Step 5: Save File
1. Use correct naming convention: `{COUNTRY}_{group#}_topic{##}_{name}.md`
2. Save in project directory: `C:\Users\rkn\Python_apps\QualAssistent\`
3. Verify file created successfully

### Step 6: Track Progress
Repeat Steps 3-5 for all 10 topics before moving to next transcript.

## Tips for Efficiency

### Read Strategically
- Skim first for structure
- Deep read for content extraction
- Use Ctrl+F to find keywords if needed

### Extract as You Read
- Keep notes of line numbers for key moments
- Mark major themes as you encounter them
- Flag great quotes immediately

### Use Consistent Structure
- Same headings/sections across similar topics
- Makes cross-group comparison easier later
- Maintain template pattern

### Don't Over-interpret
- Stick close to what was said
- Avoid reading between lines
- Let quotes speak for themselves
- Note when something is your inference vs. direct statement

## Example: Good vs. Bad Analysis

### ❌ Bad (Over-interpreted, no grounding)
```markdown
Participants were highly engaged with sustainability and wanted eco-friendly
packaging that reflected their values around environmental responsibility.
```

### ✓ Good (Grounded with evidence)
```markdown
**Sustainability Not a Priority** (lines 296-297)
- "But I don't particularly care about the sustainability in this context"
- "But otherwise I don't particularly think about them"

**Won't Pay Premium for Eco-Packaging** (line 543)
- "I wouldn't want to pay extra for having specifically the clickable
  dispenser that's more sustainable"
- "I would want to more focus on the contents, the pastel itself"
```

## After Completing All Transcripts

Once all transcripts are processed (10 topics × ~9 transcripts = ~90 files):

**Next Phase:**
1. Aggregate by topic across groups (all Group X Topic 1 files together)
2. Look for country-level patterns (FI vs. SE vs. NL)
3. Identify universal insights vs. market-specific findings
4. Create synthesis documents

**File Organization Will Enable:**
- Quick comparison: "How did all groups react to Quick Mint concept?"
- Pattern identification: "What did Finnish groups consistently say about xylitol?"
- Country differences: "How do NL attitudes toward packaging differ from FI/SE?"

## Summary: Core Principles

1. **Stay grounded** - Quote directly, cite line numbers
2. **Preserve voices** - Keep participant language and perspectives
3. **Be extensive** - Detailed summaries better than brief
4. **Track shifts** - Note how opinions change over discussion
5. **Note context** - When/why opinions are situational
6. **Mark credibility** - What's believable vs. skeptical
7. **Work with mess** - Accept imperfect transcripts
8. **Separate files** - One file per topic for each group
9. **Consistent naming** - Follow exact naming convention
10. **Quality check** - Review against checklist before finalizing

**Remember:** The goal is to create a comprehensive, grounded record of what was said that can be analyzed across groups and countries. Extensive is better than brief. Quotes are better than summaries. Specific is better than general.
