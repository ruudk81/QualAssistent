**Group:** Finland Group 1
**Transcript:** transcript_groep1_FI.txt
**Lines:** 51-235

## Overview
This section explored participants' current usage of breath freshening products, including what they use, when/why they use them, which brands they prefer, and what frustrates them about existing products.

## Products Currently Used

**Primary Products: Pastilles & Chewing Gum**
- "Pastilles or kauwgom for me" (line 58)
- Universal agreement on pastilles as primary product
- Gum mentioned as alternative option

**Why Pastilles Over Other Products**

*Mouthwash* (lines 110-117)
- Used more at home, not portable: "I would not take mouthwash in the car" (line 111)
- Too strong: "it's a little bit too strong... it stays in my mouth and it's not so good" (lines 115-116)
- Contains alcohol: "not very smart to use them, not while you're driving" (line 117)

*Sprays* (line 113)
- "Sound a little bit disgusting, like something American"
- Not preferred

**Preference for Pastilles vs. Gum** (lines 148-156)
- Pastilles digestible, gum stays in digestive tract longer (lines 148-151)
- Gum disposal problem: "you need to spit it out or get rid of it in the trash" (line 153)
- Xylitol gum causes laxative effects and gassiness (line 148)
- Both can cause laxative effects if whole package consumed (lines 149-150)

## Usage Situations

**After Smoking** (lines 61-62, 65)
- "I smoke also, so that helps to freshen up my breath"
- Multiple participants use for this purpose but some hesitant to admit

**Dry Mouth** (lines 62, 68-69, 94)
- "Sometimes it's to combat dry mouth as well"
- Agreement from multiple participants
- Also for "hoarse throat" (line 94)

**After Eating** (lines 75-78)
- "After eating something"
- Specific mention: evening snack when don't want to wait before brushing
- "If I'm chewing on pastilles, that sort of moves my thoughts" (line 78)

**Calming/Focus Aid** (lines 78-84)
- "It's a way to calm down my thoughts... when the mouth is working, then the brain calms down" (lines 79-80)
- Agreement from at least one other participant: "I know that" (line 83)

**Entertainment/Cinema** (lines 86-91)
- "If I don't have popcorn or loose candy when I'm at the cinema... then I'll have pastilles instead"
- Used as candy replacement: "just sort of for the fun of it" (line 88)

**Flu Symptoms** (line 93-94)
- "Dry mouth, hoarse throat, that kind of thing"

**Before Social/Professional Interactions** (lines 96-101, 173-179)

## Brands Used

## Frustrations & Barriers

**Packaging Issues** (lines 120-124)
- "You have them loose all over your bag" (line 120)
- "I always have a sort of loose pastille in the bottom of my bag" (line 124)
- Major pain point mentioned by multiple participants

**Wrong Flavor/Strength** (lines 125-133)
- "I try a new flavor and then I try it, but then it's not good" (line 125)
- Too strong: "it has that mouthwash effect" (line 126)
- Not strong enough: "it has no effect of freshening your breath" (line 128)

**Insufficient Effects**
- For sore throat: "if it does nothing for you in terms of refreshing or helping the sore throat, then it does nothing" (line 130)
- Needs "at least a little bit of menthol or whatever it is that activates your mouth" (line 131)
- Must have "some kind of active component" (line 132)

## Product Expectations

**Strength & Sensation** (lines 134-142)
- Must be strong: "If it's a pastille, does it have to be strong? That's usually what we're looking for" (lines 134-135)
- But different expectations for different purposes: "if it's a pastille, doesn't need to be anything other than a pleasant flavor, but then the flavor is the whole point" (line 136)
- For breath freshening: "I have to get the feeling that it is actually making fresher" (line 137)
- Agreement: "It has to have some kind of effect. It shouldn't be too strong, but it shouldn't be completely flat" (lines 141-142)

**Xylitol Association** (lines 148-159)
- Strong positive association with xylitol
- "Usually sugar-free when they have xylitol, which is good" (line 155)
- Xylitol pastilles as post-meal product (line 156)
- Distinct from sore throat lozenges: "not too much like a sore throat lozenge but just something to freshen up" (line 156)

**Product Segmentation** (lines 157-159)
- Different products for different purposes
- "I usually have different ones" (line 158)
- Fazer Xilimax for after meals vs. flavored varieties for other occasions

**Typical Breath Freshening Situation** (lines 166-200)

*Key Moment: Before Customer Meeting* (lines 173-176)
- "I don't want to have a bad breath when I meet with the customer if I expect them to be pretty close to me"
- "It's a stranger, it would be a bad impression"

*Dental Health Focus* (lines 179-180)
- "When I want to stop the dental degradation after a meal, then I want to take care of my dental health with a xylitol pastel"

*Minimum Product Requirements* (lines 181-192)
- Must have convincing flavor: "a flavor that convinces me that it actually does something for me, even if it doesn't always do it" (line 182)
- Psychological effect important: "it needs to at least make me feel like it has done its task" (line 182)
- Confidence boost: "it's also a confidence thing that I feel a bit more confident sometimes. If I have fresh breath" (lines 185-186)
- Doesn't matter if breath actually smells better: "it doesn't have to be whether or not your breath actually smells any better" (line 186)
- "You've at least tried" (line 188)
- Agreement: "if it tastes fresh and minty, then it has to do something for it" (line 191)

## Flavor Expectations

**Beyond Mint/Menthol?** (lines 195-201)
- Other flavors can cover bad breath: "there's always other flavors that can still cover up bad breath" (line 196)
- But less effective than mint: "other flavors would still feel better than nothing" (line 197)
- Key need: must "cover up" bad breath at minimum (lines 198-201)
- "Covering is pretty descriptive" (line 202)

**Dual Function Required** (line 203)
- "It must cover your bad breath and also your dental protection at the same time with xylitol or something else"

## Sensory Indicators of Effectiveness (lines 206-216)

**Taste & Smell** (lines 207-209)
- "The taste is pretty important"
- "Our mouths are pretty sensitive... it works together with your nose and your sense of smell, so that you can definitely note when it's fresher" (lines 208-209)

**Physical Sensation** (line 211)
- "If it has mint or menthol, then I get that specific taste and feeling in my mouth"

**Lack of External Feedback** (lines 213-219)
- "People usually don't give you feedback on your breath" (line 214)
- "Pretty rare to have any sort of feedback or people even asking what you've been using" (line 216)
- When it does happen: "it's been positive" (line 219)

## Packaging Importance (lines 220-235)

**Does Packaging Matter?**
- "Yes, yes, it matters a lot" (line 221)

**Successful Example: Minttu Chip** (lines 223-227)
- Hard plastic box that can close properly
- "You can't crush it accidentally and those don't spill all over your bag" (line 224)
- Some disagreement: "they'll click open and spill anyway" (line 227)

**Discretion vs. Openness** (lines 228-235)
- Most use pastilles openly: "Very openly, I would say" (line 229)
- Situation-dependent: "In some situations I need to be more discreet" (line 231)
- Workplace consideration: "I'm in a workplace where sometimes it's very quiet, so then I try to be very quiet about it" (line 233)
- Social aspect: "offering to the friends and colleagues around me" (line 234)
- Office culture: "when we used to still be at the office, then I would definitely pass them around and offer them to others" (line 235)

## Key Insights

1. **Multi-functional product**: Pastilles serve multiple purposes beyond breath freshening - dental health, dry mouth, sore throat, focus/calming, entertainment
2. **Psychological > Actual effect**: Confidence and feeling fresh matters more than whether breath actually improves
3. **Xylitol = dental health**: Strong association between xylitol and dental care benefits
4. **Packaging is critical**: Spillage in bags is major frustration
5. **Social product**: Often shared with colleagues/friends, used openly
6. **Strength spectrum**: Need for both strong (breath freshening) and milder (post-meal) options
7. **Home vs. portable**: Different product choices for home (mouthwash) vs. on-the-go (pastilles)
