# Topic 6: Branded Packs
**Group:** Finland Group 1
**Transcript:** transcript_groep1_FI.txt
**Lines:** 653-748

## Overview
Participants viewed the same three packaging concepts now with Menton branding and discussed how the brand changed their perception of credibility, fit, and appeal.

## BRANDED PACK 1: Quick Mint with Menton (lines 653-700)

**Presentation** (lines 657-661)
- Quick Mint: "quickest and easiest solution for freshening your breath on the go"
- Shown with clickable dispenser
- Branded as Menton product
- "A breath of fresh air" tagline

### Impact of Branding

**Color Scheme Works** (lines 665-666)
- "I think the blue color definitely conveys the freshening effect"
- "I think the color scheme works well for it"

**Does Branding Make It More Credible?** (lines 673-678)

*Mixed Responses:*
- "Yes, I think it's more credible" (line 673)
- "Now that it's in this familiar Menton brand, is it more credible than before? The Menton doesn't change anything for me" (lines 674-675)

**Brand vs. Having ANY Brand** (lines 677-678)
- "Does it add something if the Menton is there?"
- "Not Menton specifically, but the fact that there's some sort of form of branding and label on it, makes it more credible"

**Color Associations Important** (lines 679-680)
- "The color scheme, when we're used to certain kinds of associations with colors"
- "If this was a bright red, then we would have a very different reaction to it"

### Ongoing Dispenser Concerns (lines 682-692)

**Credible But Worried About Durability** (line 682-683)
- "It looks more credible, but I'm still a little bit concerned about when it has the clickable dispenser, how long the mechanism will actually last"
- "Or whether it will just break in my handbag and spill everywhere"

**Noise Concern** (lines 684-685)
- "Or is it a situation where, does it make a clicking noise when you click it?"
- Like clicking pens: "Does it just come to the point where people... does it just make an annoying sound like that, that people would get annoyed with me in the office?"

**Reliability Essential** (lines 686-687)
- "I want the dispenser to also be reliable, that it's not very picky"
- "When I click it, it doesn't require the pastille to be in exactly the right position and rotation for it to work. I would want it to always work with one click"

**Need to Try It** (line 688)
- "I would want to have some sort of 3D printed version that we could try that mechanism with"

### Package-Concept Fit for Quick Mint (lines 689-692)

**Does Packaging Work for "Fresh in Seconds"?** (line 689)
- "As an idea, does the packaging work for the concept, for the fresh in seconds?"

**Shouldn't Spill** (line 690-691)
- "I think Media's point is good that it shouldn't spill accidentally"
- "It shouldn't be too easy to open and then have it all over the bottom of your bag or break"

### Dispenser Preference Revisited (lines 692-700)

**Who Preferred Dispenser?** (line 692-693)
- "Who preferred the clickable dispenser more than the tab version?"

**Wants Vertical Box** (lines 693-694)
- "I liked the clickable dispenser, but not with this type of box"
- "I would like to have the vertical box"

**Need to Try First** (lines 695-696)
- "And I would want to try it first before I can give a judgment"
- "I think if it works very well, why not?"

**Mechanism Clarification** (lines 697-700)
- "Is this a sort of rocking dispenser, that when you press on it, it like a seesaw opens on the other side?"
- "Yes, that one part of it goes inside the box and then opens the hatch, it becomes a pentagon while it's in it"
- "It goes inside the box when it's closed and comes out when you use it"

## BRANDED PACK 2: Clean Feel with Menton (lines 701-736)

**Presentation** (lines 701-702)
- Clean Feel: "a fresh and clean feeling in your mouth wherever"
- With Menton branding
- Diamond-like gray-blue color pastille shown

### Visual Associations (lines 703-705)

**Toothpaste Advertising** (line 703)
- "Well, that definitely looks a lot colder when it has this blue pastel, so it reminds me of all the advertisements"

**Is That Positive?** (line 704)
- "Is that a positive thing?"
- "This is sort of a diamond-like gray-blue color"

### Xylitol Positioning (lines 706-713)

**Xylitol as Add-on, Not Core** (lines 707-710)
- "How do you feel about the Xylitol pastel being in this kind of... the clean feel being in this kind of box?"
- "I think Xylitol is just as an added element there"
- "I think the mint and menthol is the freshening effect, having this minty... minty overall flavor"
- "And xylitol then helps out with dental care"

**Looking for Mint in Flavors** (line 711-712)
- "Yes, but mostly I'm mostly just looking for the mint in the flavors"
- "Yes, but it's a mint on the box. Mint and xylitol sugar-free"

### Tab Design Feedback (lines 713-722)

**Package Fine, Tab Unnecessary** (line 714)
- "I think the package is fine, but again, I think the tab for sharing with your friends is unnecessary"

**Don't Need Multiple at Once** (line 715)
- "Yes, I don't need to have multiple at a time"

**Suitable for Concept** (lines 716-719)
- "Then what do you think about this kind of freshening pastel, those of you who use this kind of product? Is this suitable for the concept?"
- "Yes, I think so"
- "Yes"

**Smaller Tab Enough** (lines 720-722)
- "But like I said, the smaller tab is enough. You don't need the second tab"
- "And I would like it to come out easily when I turn it upside down, it'll give me one, maybe even with just one hand"
- "And because these probably aren't intended to be enjoyed multiple at a time"

### Menton Brand Fit (lines 724-736)

**Good Concept?** (lines 724-725)
- "What do you feel about if Menton came out with this kind of fresh mint and the clean feel that cleans out your mouth, it also would be sold in this kind of box? Does it feel like a good concept?"
- "It's fine"

**Similar to Market** (lines 727-728)
- "It's pretty similar to other things on the market, so it's good"
- "And of course the contents is the most important part. I would probably enjoy it in a different box as well"

**Box Wouldn't Stop Purchase** (lines 730-732)
- "Yes, but we're looking for if it was sold in this kind of box, would that stop you from buying it?"
- "No. No, no, I could never say never"

**Credible** (line 733)
- "The box is pretty credible, yep"

**Suitable for Menton** (lines 735-736)
- "And does it work for Menton?"
- "Yes, it's suitable for Menton"

## BRANDED PACK 3: Long Extreme Fresh with Menton (lines 737-748)

**Presentation** (lines 737-739)
- Same package as Clean Feel
- "Earlier you said the Long Extreme Fresh, it could be suitable for this kind of box where you don't want to have the whole box at once"
- Showing photos of branded version

### Package-Concept Fit (lines 740-748)

**Same Package as Previous?** (lines 741-742)
- "So this is the same package as the previous still?"
- "Yes"

**Very Suitable for Long-lasting** (lines 743-744)
- "Yes, same, especially for this long extreme fresh, this box is very suitable"
- "Because it has the long lasting effect"

**Agreement** (lines 745-746)
- "Anyone else? Do you agree?"

**Color Variation Noted** (lines 747-748)
- "Yes, I think it's a little bit of a different color"
- "Yes, there's small differences between the different packages, but they're otherwise pretty similar between the different concepts"

## Impact of Branding: Key Findings

### Credibility Effect

**Brand Adds Legitimacy** (line 677-678)
- Not Menton specifically, but having ANY brand makes it more credible
- Unbranded looked "work in progress" (from Topic 5)
- Brand signals it's a real product, not a concept

**Color Matters More Than Logo** (lines 665-666, 679-680)
- Blue = freshness association
- Color scheme does heavy lifting for communicating product benefits
- Brand name less important than visual design

### Menton Brand Perceptions

**Suitable/Fine/Credible** (lines 733, 736)
- Repeated use of lukewarm descriptors: "fine," "suitable," "credible"
- No strong enthusiasm for Menton specifically
- But no rejection either - acceptable carrier brand

**Similar to Market Offerings** (line 727)
- "Pretty similar to other things on the market"
- Menton with these concepts = familiar, expected, safe
- Not differentiated but not problematic

### Brand Doesn't Override Functional Concerns

**Still Worried About Dispenser** (lines 682-692)
- Brand doesn't make durability concerns go away
- Still need to actually try mechanism
- Credibility of concept ≠ confidence in execution

**Contents Still Most Important** (line 728)
- "The contents is the most important part"
- Would enjoy it in different box too
- Brand and package secondary to product performance

### Package-Concept-Brand Alignment

**Long Extreme Fresh + Tab Package + Menton = Best Fit** (lines 743-744)
- "Especially for this long extreme fresh, this box is very suitable"
- Package mechanism reinforces product promise
- When all three elements align, credibility strongest

**Quick Mint + Dispenser + Menton = Functional Concerns Remain** (lines 682-692)
- Conceptually makes sense
- But execution worries persist
- Brand can't paper over design flaws

## Shift from Unbranded to Branded

### What Changed
- Went from "work in progress" feel to "real product" (lines 508-512 vs. 677-678)
- Added legitimacy through branding presence
- Color became more obviously intentional (communicating freshness)

### What Didn't Change
- Functional concerns about durability, noise, reliability
- Preference for smaller tab only
- Need to try mechanisms before committing
- Content prioritized over package

### Menton Brand Role
- **Enabler not hero**: Makes concepts acceptable/credible but doesn't drive excitement
- **Safety**: Familiar brand reduces risk of trying new formats
- **Expected**: Menton in this category makes sense, fits naturally
- **Not differentiating**: Similar to competitors, doesn't stand out
